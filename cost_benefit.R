#        NOTES: Excludes bachelorâ€™s degree recipients who earn advanced degrees. Assumes students borrow the cost of tuition and fees and books and supplies and pay it off over 10 years after graduation with a 4.45% annual interest rate during and after college. Tuition/loan payments and earnings are discounted at 3%, compounded every year beyond age 18. The 2020-21 price is projected using the 2019-20 price and a 3% annual increase.
